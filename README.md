### Hi there, I'm Akash ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Developing a GPU-accelerated multigrid multilevel Navier Stokes solver using meshless methods, and DEVELOPING A GENERALISED CODE USING MESHLESS METHODS TO PERFORM GLOBAL LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR FLUID FLOWS IN COMPLEX GEOMETRIES
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the multigrid-NS solver project, especially optimizing the matrix library functions in the header files.
