### Hi there, I'm Akash ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a GPU-accelerated multigrid multilevel Navier Stokes solver using meshless methods, and develping a generalised code using meshless methods to perform global stability analysis for fluid flows in complex geometries
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the multigrid-NS solver project, especially optimizing the matrix library functions in the header files.
